## PROJECT 1: Anomaly Detection for Directory Traversal Attacks

This project builds a pipeline for detecting Directory Traversal attacks using log data from Elasticsearch, combining rule-based filters with a Random Forest machine learning model.

## PROJECT 2: Neural Network-Based Anomaly Detection in Active Reconnaissance Attacks

In this project, I developed two Python scripts aimed at training a neural network and deploying it for real-time anomaly detection in sensor data streams. This end-to-end system can be adapted for various time-series or IoT anomaly detection tasks.

## PROJECT 3: VPS Detection from Elasticsearch Logs

This project is a Python-based tool designed to detect whether clients accessing a system using known VPS (Virtual Private Server) providers. It queries an Elasticsearch index for logs within the last 10 minutes, filters distinct client IPs, checks them against a known list of VPS providers using MaxMind's GeoLite2 ASN database, and exports the results to a CSV.
