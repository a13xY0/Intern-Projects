## PROJECT 1:

Anomaly Detection for Directory Traversal Attacks
This project builds a pipeline for detecting Directory Traversal attacks using log data from Elasticsearch, combining rule-based filters with a Random Forest machine learning model.

## PROJECT 2:

Neural Network-Based Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data
In this project, I developed two Python scripts aimed at training a neural network and deploying it for real-time anomaly detection in sensor data streams. This end-to-end system can be adapted for various time-series or IoT anomaly detection tasks.
